##Vouching for Aimintor.com (Ticket #9083)

Hey Phantom Review Team,

I wanted to reach out and vouch for the Aimintor.com project that's getting flagged in your wallet.
I'm James, working at Goonomics in the Solana ecosystem. You can find me on GitHub (@ilertha) and X (@ilertha_ybarra) if you want to check out my work.
I've actually collaborated with the Aimintor team on several projects over the past few months - we've worked together on token creation tools, transaction bundlers, and we're currently discussing a Solana AI agent project. I've seen how they code and can confirm they're implementing the signAndSendTransaction method correctly.
Their project is legit and adds real value to the ecosystem by improving how memecoins work on social platforms. There's no security concerns that should trigger those wallet warnings.
Happy to answer any questions you might have!

Cheers,
James Ybarra
